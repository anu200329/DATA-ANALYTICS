## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of social media ad campaigns. By leveraging EDA techniques, we can extract insights related to: 

• Conversion rates based on demographics

• Cost efficiency of campaigns

• Segmentation based on gender, age, and other features

The analysis will help in identifying which campaigns are performing well and which segments of the audience contribute most to the success of the ads.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on various social media ads, their impressions, clicks, spend, and conversions. It is assumed that the dataset includes demographic details like age and gender for audience segmentation.
• Source: Kaggle Clicks Conversion Tracking Dataset (hypothetical link)

• Attributes:

    o	Ad ID: Unique identifier for each ad

    o	Impressions: Number of times an ad was shown

    o	Clicks: Number of times an ad was clicked

    o	Conversions: Number of conversions (e.g., sales, signups)

    o	Spend: The total cost spent on the ad

    o	Gender: Gender of the audience

    o	Age Group: Age group of the audience

## Objectives
• Analyze Conversion Rate: Calculate conversion rates and analyze which demographics contribute to higher conversions.

• Segment Performance: Segment ad performance based on demographic features (e.g., gender, age).

• Evaluate Cost Efficiency: Analyze the cost per conversion and identify cost-efficient campaigns.

• Campaign Insights: Extract actionable insights to improve future campaigns.

## Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

• Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning

• Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization

• NumPy: For numerical operations

• Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis

• Scikit-learn: For potential predictive analysis (if applicable)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project focuses on performing the following EDA tasks:

Data Cleaning:

o Handling missing values

o Removing duplicates



## Data Visualization: 
o Gender-based and age-based ad performance distributions

o Conversion analysis across different demographic segments

o Cost analysis and ROI (Return on Investment)

## Performance Metrics:
o Calculating conversion rates (Clicks to Conversions)

o Analyzing click-through rates (CTR)

o Campaign cost efficiency

## Segmentation:
o Demographic-based segmentation

o Identifying top-performing segments

## Usage
Load the dataset and perform data cleaning:
